The Copperfield Migrator
========================

What is it?
-----------
Copperfield is a tool that helps to *migrate data* between databases. Note how
the focus is different from e.g. that of ActiveRecord's migrations: the tool
doesn't help to modify a database schema, it helps to move data *across
different databases*.
